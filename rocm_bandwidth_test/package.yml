summary    : RocBandwidthTest is designed to capture the performance characteristics of buffer copying and kernel read/write operations. The help screen of the benchmark shows various options one can use in initiating cop/read/writer operations. In addition one can also query the topology of the system in terms of memory pools and their agents
